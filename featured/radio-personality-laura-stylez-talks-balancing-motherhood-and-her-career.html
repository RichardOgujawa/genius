                            having her daughter in a pandemic.</span>

                    <p>
                        Before radio personality Laura Stylez became a mother, nothing was more important to her than
                        her career. “When I was just starting, I lived my entire life working,” Stylez tells Genius.
                        “Everything was radio, because I needed to learn all the aspects of it.”

                        That dedication is largely the reason for Stylez’s rise to success. In the early days of her New
                        York radio career, the Los Angeles native was often the only one willing to take unwanted
                        shifts, run the audio boards behind the scenes, or host club nights for a measly couple hundred
                        bucks. “I used to be in the studio every single day, Monday through Friday,” she says. “If you
                        needed me on Saturdays, I would be there. In my line of work, there are a lot of hours that you
                        have to put in.”

                        The hours certainly paid off—in 2013, Stylez earned a full-time spot as co-host of HOT97’s
                        flagship program Ebro in the Morning, through which she’s built a dedicated fan base of over
                        225K Instagram followers and interviewed everyone from Cardi B to Tyler, the Creator. That gig
                        has brought her other opportunities, too. Over the years, she’s hosted red carpet events and
                        lent her voice to commercials and video games, including Grand Theft Auto.

                        In 2020, however, when she embarked on a new kind of journey—motherhood—Stylez had to reassess
                        everything, and the discourse surrounding mothers in the music industry wasn’t exactly
                        encouraging. ”I grew up at a time where everyone would tell you, ‘Don’t get pregnant. You’ll
                        never have a career,’” Stylez says.

                        She wound up seeking inspiration from women who defied those expectations. Like Cardi B, who
                        famously announced her pregnancy on SNL just as her career was taking off. “So many people were
                        telling her, ‘Your career will be over, it’s done. It’s not going to happen. You’re just
                        starting,’” Stylez says. “And then we saw her perform her ass off. And she’s still at the top of
                        her career.”

                        But motherhood is still harder than Stylez imagined. For starters, she couldn’t have predicted
                        the world would shut down over a pandemic during her pregnancy. As a high-risk individual,
                        Stylez felt scared to leave her house to get air, and she had to beg her doctors to allow her
                        partner in the delivery room. After she gave birth and it was time to return to work, things got
                        worse before they got better.

                        “I had this insane guilt about being away from my child and leaving her with my partner,” she
                        says. “And I dealt with postpartum depression. One of the hardest parts about motherhood and
                        going back to work was giving myself grace and the time that I needed to not only heal
                        physically, but emotionally. I had to really, really, really take my time in figuring out what
                        tools I needed to make my life a little easier.”

                        As she adjusted to life as a mom, Stylez made a few career changes. First, she switched to a
                        hybrid schedule, working a few days in the studio and a few days from home. She also got a lot
                        more selective about what after-hours events she’ll agree to attend. “In our line of work,
                        there’s always a listening party and a concert,” Stylez says. “But I don’t really go out to
                        evening events unless I really want to do it. It has to be something important because I have to
                        get a babysitter.”

                        Stylez is first to admit those modifications might not have been feasible if she were at an
                        earlier phase in her career—and they definitely wouldn’t have been possible if she didn’t have
                        the support of a good partner, her “tribe” of mothers, and her team at HOT97, which includes
                        co-hosts Ebro Darden and Peter Rosenberg. She recalls a few times when she would be dozing off
                        or having to throw up during a broadcast, and her co-hosts would cover for her. “They helped me
                        tremendously,” she says. “I really wish all women could have the type of support that I have at
                        work, because I’ve heard too many horror stories.”

                        That level of support extends to Stylez’s fans as well. As soon as she announced her pregnancy
                        on air, she got a swarm of positive responses from listeners. “People were calling in like,
                        ‘Welcome to motherhood. This makes me so happy. I feel like I know you,’" she says. “Regular,
                        amazing, everyday people. I was in tears.”

                        Now, Stylez sees motherhood as a career strength, not a weakness. In fact, it’s made her even
                        more driven to succeed, now that she has “someone else to provide for.” Motherhood has also
                        introduced Stylez to a whole different demographic of social media followers who appreciate her
                        transparency, and it’s inspired new on-air segments. She recently opened up the phone lines to
                        ask women how much maternity leave they took after giving birth. Their responses were
                        eye-opening.

                        “We had women calling and saying, ‘I had to go back to work the next day, because if I didn’t
                        get paid, I couldn’t pay the rent,’” Stylez says. “It’s almost like a luxury, because I’m able
                        to work for a company who allowed me the time I needed. Not everyone is guaranteed that, and it
                        really broke my heart to learn how many people didn’t have that.”

                        For expectant mothers juggling careers in music, Stylez hopes her journey can be an example.
                        It’s possible to become a parent without sacrificing your dreams; all it takes is a little
                        patience, a lot of support, and some balance—though that last one can be tricky. “When I’m
                        working at home, there’s times where my partner will come out with my little girl and she’s
                        screaming,” Stylez says with a laugh. “I’m in the middle of a show, the dog’s barking and it’s
                        chaotic.”

                        At the end of the day, her daughter makes even the most hectic of times worth it, though. “I
                        can’t believe that she came out of me,” Stylez says, beaming with gratitude. “I created a human
                        being.”
