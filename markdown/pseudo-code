# IDEAS

For the disortion effect 
- try p5.js. 
- Try using sine wave in JS.

- Fix the background of the menu to come on after the preload
- put the navbar in front of all the content using z-index

Overall structuree
- start from the aoutside, build the framework, and simply fill in the contents afterwards. 
- Make each component responsive as you go 

## Featured Section 
- Use the cloning idea from the carousel. Every time you click on the button, the a new div with two sections is created

## Notes for when you come back tomorrow
- ~fix the featured-links border-bottom~
- ~Do the button hover effect, maybe just use a ::after pseudo element and then overflow hidden it, and then simply increse it's size.~
- ~When you move down the page, the GENIUS logo enlarges, and the bringing you the meaning text comes in ~ 
- ~Create the cursor icon - just do something simply and use the invert effect~
- ~Add a preload screen~.....
- ~Make sure the mobile view works~
- Do the liquid effect using blender and distortion effects, maybe the sea modifier or something. 
- use RGB Kinetic slider and simply make the array all the images, and let them all be called upon in a forEach loop.
