# Genius

## Summary

I coded a <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/140483359/GENIUS-website-redesign?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cwebsite"> redesign of Genius.com by Pavel Korzh</a> 

To check out the website check out this <a href="https://richardogujawa.github.io/genius/">link</a>

The main focus of the page is the <strong>Homepage</strong> and the <strong>Components</strong> page (where I practised building out the functionalities present throughout Pavel's design.  

Of course I made it so that the <em>rest of the page is functional</em> in that the links work, the article links actually lead to articles on Genius' website, etc. However, the <em>only two fully custom built-out pages</em> are the Homepage and the <strong>Components page</strong> (accessible via the navigation bar on the website). 

I also used Adobe XD to re-designe the Featured Page that Pavel designed. I did so not as a critique on Pavel's work by any means, but rather I just wanted to add back in some features from the original <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius.com</a> page that I thought would be nice to code.
