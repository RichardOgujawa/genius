# Genius

## Summary

I coded a <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/140483359/GENIUS-website-redesign?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cwebsite"> redesign of Genius.com by Pavel Korzh</a> 

To check out the website check out this <a href="https://ro-genius.netlify.app/">link</a>

The main focus of the page is the <strong>Homepage</strong> and the <strong>Components</strong> page (where I practised building out the functionalities present throughout Pavel's design) 

I made some parts of the website work too, for demonstration purposes, but did so by, for example, using links to articles that already exist Genius' website. 

I also used Adobe XD to re-design the Featured Page that Pavel designed. I did so not as a critique on Pavel's work, but rather I thought it would be nice to include some more of the features from the original 2022 version of the <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius.com</a> website.
