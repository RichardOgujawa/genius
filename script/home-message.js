console.log(`Hi👋🏾 Just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for taking the time to check out my work. This project was made possible by a design I found on Behance.net by Pavel Korzh. So, if you like the design please check out more of his work there. 🖼️

The major focus of this project was to practice skills I have learned and try out new things. So I only built the homepage and a page with some of the major functional components of this site (including a music player, comments section and lyrics with annotations on the highlighted parts like is the case on the Genius.com). If you want to check out that page please click on the components link in the navigation bar.

Thanks again, and I hope you like what you see.`)
