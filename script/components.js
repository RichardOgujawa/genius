I decided to code some of the key components of the design by Pavel and hopefully make them in such a way that they can be easily simply copied 📋 and pasted 🗃️ onto other parts of the website.

This was my first time using things like JSON files, and also truly problem solving using JavaScript. This project, of course, didn't teach me everything, and I still have a long way to go, but it did open my eyes to the capabilities of the JS language and how future coding problems 👾 could potentially be solved 🕹️.`);
